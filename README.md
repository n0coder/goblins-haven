# Goblin's Haven: The Search for the Lost Toys
A lighthearted and silly adventure game where you search for a legendary toy deep within a cave. Defeat silly creatures and obstacles, and use your wits and weapons to progress through the levels.

### Important Note:
this project contains 80% code that chatgpt helped generate... later I will add comments which outline what i asked it to write to give me the written code... as that should help others use chatgpt later in the future

#### Trigger warning: the game's story will talk about AI and ChatGPT
